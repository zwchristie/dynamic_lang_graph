        General Question Answering Flow:
        
        This flow handles general questions and provides comprehensive answers. It works by:
        1. Analyzing the user's question to understand intent and requirements
        2. Generating a detailed response based on the analysis
        3. Finalizing and formatting the response for the user
        
        Capabilities:
        - Answer factual questions
        - Provide explanations and tutorials
        - Give opinions and recommendations
        - Handle complex multi-part questions
        - Acknowledge limitations when information is not available
        
        Use this flow for any general question that doesn't require specialized tools or workflows.
